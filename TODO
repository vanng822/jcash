Genaral/both:
-Move some (public) functions, such as get*Manager, dynamicHelpers
 from both image.js and static.js to index.js and combine them in a clearer way

-Write a sync script to load new config, generate and dump before server starts/restarts
 Which means better dump and load method

Image:
-Symbolic link (if possible) or Serving image instead "static handler".
 Just map the new url to the file and skip writting to dist.
 This will reduce write operations for faster startup and don't need to clean up the dist.
